# No More X

A simple browser extension that does the following:

* Replaces the ugly X "logo" with the proper Twitter bird logo
* Replaces "X" with "Twitter" in titles
* Automatically redirect from "x.com" to "twitter.com" (this removes the need to disable privacy protection extensions as well)

## To install

Clone (download) this repository into a folder locally, and use "load unpacked" or another similar feature in your browser to load this extension.
